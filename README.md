# 🏥 Health Clinic Appointment Management System (HCAMS)

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Health Clinic Appointment Management System (HCAMS)** is a full-stack web application designed and implemented as part of the *Advanced Databases and Big Data (U14440)* module. This system supports both administrative and patient-facing functionality to improve the efficiency and usability of clinical appointment scheduling.

HCAMS is tailored to the requirements of the fictional **City Health Clinic**, aiming to solve real-world problems such as appointment clashes, inefficient record keeping, and lack of centralized digital systems.


## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Enable patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments via a user-friendly interface.
- Provide clinic staff with a robust admin dashboard.
- Ensure data integrity, scalability, and responsiveness using MongoDB and modern web tools.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system follows a **modular MVC architecture**:

- **Frontend**: A responsive SPA (Single Page Application) built using React.js.
- **Backend**: RESTful API developed with Django, interfacing MongoDB through PyMongo.
- **Database**: MongoDB NoSQL structure using embedded and referenced documents for scalability and performance.

## 💻 Installation & Usage Guide

> ⚠️ Recommended: Use **Visual Studio Code** and ensure **Python 3.11** is installed.

### 1️⃣ Download project /clone it


### 2️⃣ Set Up the Backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
The backend will run at: http://localhost:8000


  
### 3️⃣ Set Up the Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm install framer-motion --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run at: http://localhost:3000
### ⚠️ You can create your own patient by registering " use an existing email to test receiving email after booking (spam box) " or Use the json file " user_credentials.json" to access different patients, doctors , admin accounts

## Database Access
### MongoDB Compass
1.Download mongodb compass 

2.Add new connection

3.add the url below:

mongodb+srv://elayoub407:MVmL7Axgvj4Ia4MR@hcams.8au6zot.mongodb.net/

## 🧪 Testing
Testing includes manual validation of:

Frontend responsiveness across devices

Backend REST API endpoints

Appointment conflict handling

CRUD operations for patients and doctors

Query performance and indexing strategies in MongoDB

Automated tests can be added using:

Pytest or unittest for backend logic


## 🚀 Deployment
This project is currently configured for local development only.

For production deployment, consider:

Hosting frontend on Vercel or Netlify

Hosting backend on Heroku or Railway

Using MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data persistence

Adding environment variables for secure credentials
